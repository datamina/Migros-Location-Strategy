#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
Identifying the most strategic locations to expand Migros stores by analyzing key market factors:

* Existing Store Density: Where Migros is already present.
* Competitor Presence: Including Denner as a competitor.
* Population Density: More potential customers, better sales.
* Local GDP: Higher purchasing power means better store performance.

### Methods Used
* Web scraping
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter


## Project Description

### Strategy
* Focus on Migros flagship stores vs. flagship stores of other major retailers.
* Consider Denner as a competitor, despite Migros' ownership (70% since 2007).
* Aim to expand Migros' market share by tar

### Data & Methodology
* Geographical Scope: 26 Swiss cantons.
* Data Sources: OpenStreetMap, Swiss Federal Statistics (BFS), and other open data.
#### Collected Metrics:
* Number & distribution of supermarkets.
* Proportion of Migros stores vs. total supermarkets.
* Potential customers per store.
* Store density per canton.
* GDP per capita per region.
#### Tools & Techniques:
* Data Processing: pandas for analysis.
* Visualization: matplotlib & plotly for interactive maps and graphs.
* Web Scraping: Extracting relevant data from public sources.
#### Constraints
* 3-day challenge
* Due to issues retrieving data for the cantons of Aargau and Schaffhausen, we were unable to include them in this research. Given time constraints, we had to proceed without their analysis.


## Key Findings
* 5 Swiss towns identified as prime locations for new Migros stores.
* 4 of them in 2 cantons expected to experience significant population growth in the next decade (according to BFS projections).
